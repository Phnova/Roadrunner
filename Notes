How to track rotation:
- Compass + gyro
- Compass
- Use sensors to calculate

Simplest solution is to depthsensors and continuously monitor distance relative to direction
Compass + gyro can give absolute position, but is more complicated
IR is the definitive standard in regards to accuracy in local position. 
	- Use stationary IR sender with reciever on unit
	- The stationary IR sender will work as a reference point

Todo:
- Convert existing functioning code into tasks and task body
- Make states
- Drawing to document how the servo works
- Mount rear sensor to servo

Questions for Stephen/Henning
